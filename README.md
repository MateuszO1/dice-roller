Created this website for Software Engineering. The site is a simple dice roller that rolls six instances of dice for a game. It rolls all the dice on load of the page and the roll button has autofocus so enter can be used to re-roll the dice.

# Instructions
Upon loading the page the five dice are all rolled. You can re-roll all five dice at once using the roll button or enter.
